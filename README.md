# Eat-Da-Burger
A "burger logger" which utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM to perform CRUD operations from the browswer. 

## What does it do?
The user can type in the the name of any burger they would like to eat, and it will be added to the list of burgers available. Each burger has a "devour it" button, upon clicking, the burger is 'eaten' and moved to the right side of the page.
